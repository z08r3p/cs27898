A company called Crazy   Eddie   Electronics   has come to   us   in   need of   help.Crazy   Eddie would   like   to   move   his   business    into    the 21st century, but   he doesn't know   how. He knows he wants to build a website,but he   doesn't   know the first thing about how to do this.He   has   decided to   crowdsource   this   problem   to   the   studentsof
AD648,and   he'l give $1   million   USDto the   person who can design the   best site for   Crazy   Eddie   Electronics.
Eddie has somevery   particular design specifications that he   needs you to   follow. They are:
1.Inside the body of the document,be sure to add the following      information:
a.Crazy       Eddie's         store         location
b.Crazy       Eddie's         store       hours
c.Crazy       Eddie's       store       contact       information
2.Crazy    Eddie    apparently    likes    pictures,and    he    has      asked      that      you      please      include      at      leastthree         pictures   on   your    site.Include   three   pictures    of   electronics    items    for    sale.These   pics    should   be   from   somewhere   on   the   web.
3.Crazy   Eddie   has    asked   that   you    include    atleast    six    paragraphs    on   the   page   that    describe    items
that   are   sold   in   his   store.Remember,he   is   a   little   bit   crazy.He   wants   each   of   these   paragraphs   to   be   written   in   a   separate   font,with   a   separate   color,and   in   a   separate   size.You   do   not   need   to write    long    paragraphs--one      sentence    per      paragraph      is      fine.In      HTML,paragraphs      go      between the   and   tags.
4.Crazy   Eddie   has   asked   that   you   include   at   least   two   lists   on   the   page.These   lists   can   be   ordered   or      unordered.
5.Crazy Eddie has asked that you include a table on your page.You   can use this to   describe   anything       related       to       his       business.
6.Crazy Eddie is so crazy that he's guaranteeing that he can be beat   the prices   of   any   competitor代 写Part I: (Crazy Eddie HTML project)SQL
代做程序编程语言   He's      so      confident    that    he       can    beat      their      prices,he      has       asked    you      to       include       links    to    three       of    his   competitors       somewhere         on         the         site.To submit this assignment,you'll upload your   .HTML file   into   Blackboard.If   Blackboard   doesn't   allow   you   to         upload   it,you can try uploading   it as a.ZIP file   instead.Here   is a   link 4Ways to Make a Zip File-wikiHow to   a   tutorial about making   a.ZIP file.
The most important thingsto keep in mind for thisassignment: 
●The goal of this assignment is to expose you to   HTMLand web   design not to stress you out.Any      truly
good-faith effort to   learn fromthis and have   somefun   in   the   process will   earn   you   a   good   credit   for this   part   of the assignment.This is not a website design   class.Even   if   none   of your   HTML seems   to   be working,just
submit what you've   done,andyou will   receive   credit.
o   NONE of this   must be realistic."Mars"is a completely fine   store   location.
●SublimeText   isfree to download,and a good tool to use for   making   and   editing   an   HTML   file.So   is   Text               Wrangler.Both are completely free   HTMLeditors.They are awesome.If you use TextEdit,expect formatting   problems.When using a program like   Sublime Text,you   can   use   the"Save As"feature   to   indicate   that   your         file should   be an   HTMLfile.Save   it to your desktop,oranother folder that   you   use   often.When   you   click   on      the      name    of      thefile,itwillopen       inabrowser.●Every question you could   possibly   have(e.g.How do l   puta   list on   a web   page?What   about   a   table?)can   be answered here:http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp .You can also   e-mail   Prof.Tomic   or your         assigned   Facilitator anytime withany question.
●Each student   is   required to submit   his/her own Crazy   Eddie   page,but   by all   means,use any   resource            available to you--other students inthe class,Google searches,the"Crazy   Eddie   FAQ"video on our   class   Blackboard site,etc.
This   is some   HTMLcode toget you started--you   may run into formatting   problems   if you   copy   and   paste   this,so   I suggest typing itinstead:
